# ngpdx_weather_demo
The demo app used for the presentation: $q tips for the ng-pdx meet-up May 20th, 2015 

To run the project, here is what you need (make sure you have grunt installed): 
npm install
bower install
grunt client:serve

This will start the app/server on port 9000. Happy javascripting!
